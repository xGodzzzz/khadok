## 🚀 Project Description

Khadok streamlines every step of the ordering journey:

1. **Consumers** browse nearby restaurants on an interactive map, place orders for delivery or pickup, book dine-in tables, and view 3D restaurant interiors before arriving.
2. **Stakeholders** manage menus, pricing, table inventory, upload 360° interior tours, and monitor incoming orders in real time.
3. **Riders** receive optimized delivery assignments, track their route, update deliveries via mobile, and view their performance dashboard.
4. **Admins** oversee the entire system: user management, session auditing, analytics, and compliance.
